            <h1>Reproduction:</h1>
            <h2>Note that male and female lions are usually ready to mate at the age of 3 to 4 years, and their gestation period is about 4 months. The female lion must give birth to her cubs away from the members of the pack and hides her cubs for the first 6 weeks. Lion cubs weigh only 1.5 kg at birth and are very dependent on their mother. It is interesting to know that all the female lions of the herd perform mating at the same time as the male lions of the group, and after 6 weeks of the birth of the cubs, all the female lions of the herd take good care of their cubs or others.</h2>
